# project_1

In this project we examined data from 2019 presented by the World Health Organization (WHO) showing mortality rates attributed to ambient and household air pollution by country. WHO defines ambient air pollution as: “pollution resulting (results) from emissions from industrial activity, households, cars and trucks”.  Household was briefly described as fuel used for cooking. The data is broken down into death rates by air pollution linked diseases, including: 1) Lower respiratory infections in general population; 2) Stroke in adults; 3) ischemic heart diseases in adults; 4) Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases in adults; and 5) Trachea, bronchus, and lung cancers in adults. We found the five countries with the highest and lowest total death rates across both sexes. We determined the average total death rate in both sexes to be 100.77 in 100,000 people. We also examined which illness had the highest mortality rate between sexes. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/114604704/207217197-fc51b51f-4c5d-475d-8c2a-cf4be8d1b091.png)
